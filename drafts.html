		<h2><em>Digital Mock Up</em></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Project Summary</li>
				<p>My website's goal is to provide information on the Large Millimeter Telescope, one of the most powerful telescopes in the world. It's a sub-topic on the topic of space exploration and the wonders of discovering what's out there in the final frontier. I'd like to explore how the LMT works, the LMT's basic structure and some of the amazing photos the LMT takes.</p>
			<li>Audience Profile</li>
				<p>Mostly children with smartphones or access to smartphones will be my key demographic. After that will be kids interested in seeing the full website on their desktops and/or laptops. This is a project geared towards kids being interested in space exploration and the study of space.</p>
			<li>Perception & Tone</li>
				<p>The tone of the project will be geared towards making things simple, entertaining and lighthearted. The purpose is to simplify the Large Millimeter Telescope enough so that kids can understand just one of the many tools used to study the stars.</p>
			<li>Communication Strategy</li>
				<p>I will be creating a step by step guide where in kids can move from screen to screen, taking them from day to night. During the day the LMT gets prepared and kids can explore different parts of it as well as some video footage of what it's like to be in Sierra Negra. Then at the end, when the background gets dark and transitions towards night the child can then pretend to take photos using the large millimeter telescope and see what kinds of images it captures</p>
			<li>Target Message</li>
				<p>The target message of my website is to celebrate space exploration, the study of space and how it's done by scientists. Kids may not be able to have one of their own but the idea is to inform, include them in part of the experience and to continue the fantasy people have with exploring the unknown.</p>
